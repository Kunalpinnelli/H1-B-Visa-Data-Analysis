# H1-B-Visa-Data-Analysis-using-PySpark

Overview:

This study focuses on H1-B visa applications filed between 2015 and 2021, shedding light on this particular visa category issued by the USA government for work permits. The H1-B visa has recently garnered attention due to its controversial nature, primarily attributed to its limitations and the uncertainty surrounding the lottery-based issuance process. This report presents key findings derived from the analysis conducted on data sourced from Data.gov, aiming to uncover any patterns or qualifications influencing the success rate of visa approvals.

Methodology:

Throughout the analysis, Spark played a crucial role in coding, data pre-processing, and data visualization phases. The entire workflow was executed using the Zeppelin Notebook, with additional insights drawn using SQL query language to extract anticipated inferences from the dataset. All processed data and results have been stored in a MongoDB database for reference.

Key Objectives:

Identifying Patterns: Analyzing data to identify patterns or qualifications that contribute to a higher success rate in H1-B visa approvals.
Role and Location Analysis: Utilizing the results to pinpoint roles and locations with high H1-B success rates, providing valuable insights into visa issuance dynamics and criteria.

How to Use:

Explore the analysis results to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing H1-B visa approval rates. The identified patterns can aid individuals in comprehending the basic dynamics and criteria associated with the issuance of this visa.

Technologies Used:

Spark for coding, data pre-processing, and data visualization.
Zeppelin Notebook for workflow execution.
SQL for extracting inferences from the data.
MongoDB for storing processed data and results.

Future Considerations:

The insights derived from this analysis can serve as a foundation for further research into the evolving landscape of H1-B visa applications and contribute to informed discussions on visa policies.
